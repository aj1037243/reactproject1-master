        <p>
            This project started with three young college students trying to create a oppurtunity
            to make a passion project that can resonate not only with current students but other students as well
            who fill as if they miss out on Athens and the night life it has to offer. We wanted to bridge that gap
            and create a easily accesible website that could be used throughout campus as a way to find new things to do
            within athens
